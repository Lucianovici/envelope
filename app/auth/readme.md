Please follow the instructions from http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html

Create your own file from the google developer console.
Make sure you set your environment variable `ENVELOPE_AUTH_JSON_FILE_PATH` as an absolute path to your file. 

Also notice that I added the custom `sheet_id` in this json file as well.
